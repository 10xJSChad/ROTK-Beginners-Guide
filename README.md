# ROTK Beginners Guide

Classes
------
ROTK has a total of three classes, the **gatherer**, **blacksmith**, and **engineer**.
<br>
### Gatherer
The gatherer is the only class capable of gathering ore and wood, it does not have any unique crafting recipes.
<br>
### Blacksmith
The blacksmith has the majority of the crafting recipes in ROTK, everything from buckets to plate armor and custom swords is crafted by the blacksmith.
<br>
### Engineer
The engineer is a master of crafting weapons of destruction. The majority of engineer crafting recipes are for combat and as such this is a class best suited for organized groups that may find themselves fighting a war.
