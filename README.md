# ROTK Beginners Guide

Classes
------
ROTK has a total of three classes, the **gatherer**, **blacksmith**, and **engineer**.
To select a class, you have to talk to the class master NPC for the class you wish to become. Once you have selected a class you will not be able to switch until the **server-wide** class selection cooldown reset. This happens every 10 days.

### Gatherer
The gatherer is the only class capable of gathering ore and wood, it does not have any unique crafting recipes.
<br>
### Blacksmith
The blacksmith has the majority of the crafting recipes in ROTK, everything from buckets to plate armor and custom swords is crafted by the blacksmith.
<br>
### Engineer
The engineer is a master of crafting weapons of destruction. The majority of engineer crafting recipes are for combat and as such this is a class best suited for organized groups that may find themselves fighting a war.

Languages
------
As of ROTK 2.1, there are a total of X languages to choose from; English, Polish, Latin, Hungarian, German, and French.
By default, everyone speaks the same language known as 'Common'. When you first spawn with a fresh character, you'll be prompted to pick a second language.
Using the player menu (RCTRL), you are able select your currently active language. 

When speaking anything but common, only players that speak the same language as you will be able to read what you are saying. Players that do not know the language will simply see gibberish text, intended to look similar to the real-world language.

### Learning languages

You can learn another language by interacting with a language book, when opened, it will prompt you to translate a random word from that language. The only way for you to know which word you need to enter is by having help from a player who speaks the language you're trying to learn. If the correct word is entered, you will earn experience towards learning a new language.

When a player interacts with the language book of a language they already know, it will tell them the correct word that a non-speaker of the language would have to enter when using the book.

After entering a word, there is an hour cooldown before you can interact with a book again.

Crafting
------
There are three different crafting stations as of ROTK 2.1; the anvil, workbench, and countertop.
Each crafting station has a different set of recipes that can be crafted using it.

Smelting
------
Ore has to be smelted into bars in order to be crafted into anything, you can smelt ore at a furnace.

To smelt your ore, simply interact with a furnace and select your ore. Once your ore has been inserted into the furnace, you will need to power the furnace with coal by performing a held interact on the furnace while having coal in your inventory.

Farming
------
Seeds can obtained from wild plants and planted at a soil plot. To plant a seed, interact with a soil plot and select the seed you want to plant.
To farm effectively, your loadout should have each of these weapons: Watering Can, Hoe, and Sickle.

Once the seed is planted, you'll have to water it by interacting with the plot while holding a Watering Can. Overwatering the crop will cause it to take damage and eventually die if left overwatered for too long.

If your crop dies, you can clear the soil plot of the dead crop by hitting it with a Hoe.
Once your crop is fully grown, it can be harvested by interacting with the soil plot while holding a Sickle.
