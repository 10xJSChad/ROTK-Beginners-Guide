# ROTK Beginners Guide

Classes
------
ROTK has a total of three classes, the **gatherer**, **blacksmith**, and **engineer**.
To select a class, you have to talk to the class master NPC for the class you wish to become. Once you have selected a class you will not be able to switch until the **server-wide** class selection cooldown reset. This happens every 10 days.

### Gatherer
The gatherer is the only class capable of gathering ore and wood, it does not have any unique crafting recipes.
<br>
### Blacksmith
The blacksmith has the majority of the crafting recipes in ROTK, everything from buckets to plate armor and custom swords is crafted by the blacksmith.
<br>
### Engineer
The engineer is a master of crafting weapons of destruction. The majority of engineer crafting recipes are for combat and as such this is a class best suited for organized groups that may find themselves fighting a war.

Languages
------
As of ROTK 2.1, there are a total of X languages to choose from; English, Polish, Latin, Hungarian, German, and French.
By default, everyone speaks the same language known as 'Common'. When you first spawn with a fresh character, you'll be prompted to pick a second language.
Using the player menu (RCTRL), you are able select your currently active language. 

When speaking anything but common, only players that speak the same language as you will be able to read what you are saying. Players that do not know the language will simply see gibberish text, intended to look similar to the real-world language.

### Learning languages

You can learn another language by interacting with a language book, when opened, it will prompt you to translate a random word from that language. The only way for you to know which word you need to enter is by having help from a player who speaks the language you're trying to learn. If the correct word is entered, you will earn experience towards learning a new language.

When a player interacts with the language book of a language they already know, it will tell them the correct word that a non-speaker of the language would have to enter when using the book.

After entering a word, there is an hour cooldown before you can interact with a book again.

Gathering
------
There are various raw materials that can be gathered by any player of the gatherer class.

The current raw materials are: Iron Ore, Gold Ore, Sulphur, Rock, Coal, and Wood Log.<br>
All of these materials, excluding Coal, are not stackable.

To gather these materials, simply hit them with the appropriate tool (Pickaxe or Hatchet), if you hit it with the correct tool then you will see either green or yellow sparks come out of the location you hit. 

Green sparks mean you're gathering correctly. <br>
Yellow sparks means you have worn T3 armor at some point in your current life, and will therefore have a significantly lower chance of successfully gathering, but gathering is still possible. <br>
Red sparks mean you are using the wrong tool or are dealing too little damage, and have no chance of gathering.
<br><br>
***NOTE: Gathering sparks do NOT look like the normal sparks that appear when you hit something, these look like small floaty orbs, a bit fantasy looking.***

Crafting
------
There are three different crafting stations as of ROTK 2.1; the anvil, workbench, and countertop.
Each crafting station has a different set of recipes that can be crafted using it.

Smelting
------
Ore has to be smelted into bars in order to be crafted into anything, you can smelt ore at a furnace.

To smelt your ore, simply interact with a furnace and select your ore. Once your ore has been inserted into the furnace, you will need to power the furnace with coal by performing a held interact on the furnace while having coal in your inventory.

Baking
------
Baking produces food that can be consumed for temporary health/stamina buffs, ingredients crafted into raw food at a countertop.
To cook your raw food, insert it into a baking oven by interacting with it and selecting the correct recipe, then add firewood to the baking oven by performing a held interact on it while having firewood in your inventory.

Be careful not to burn your food by forgetting it in the oven after it's done cooking!

Distilling/Brewing
------
The process of creating alcoholic drinks is identical to baking, except for that whatever you are distilling or brewing can't be burnt.

Once you have a finished barrel of alcohol, you can insert it into a keg (taverns should have one keg at the very least). You can then grab a mug or chalice and fill it up using the keg! 

Use the 'Drink' emote to take a swig of your drink, but take it slow unless you want to get absolutely hammered.


Farming
------
Seeds can obtained from wild plants and planted at a soil plot. To plant a seed, interact with a soil plot and select the seed you want to plant.
To farm effectively, your loadout should have each of these weapons: Watering Can, Hoe, and Sickle.

Once the seed is planted, you'll have to water it by interacting with the plot while holding a Watering Can. Overwatering the crop will cause it to take damage and eventually die if left overwatered for too long.

If your crop dies, you can clear the soil plot of the dead crop by hitting it with a Hoe.
Once your crop is fully grown, it can be harvested by interacting with the soil plot while holding a Sickle.
